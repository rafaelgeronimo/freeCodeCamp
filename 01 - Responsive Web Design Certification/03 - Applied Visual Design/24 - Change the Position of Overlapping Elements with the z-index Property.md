When elements are positioned to overlap, the element coming later in the HTML markup will, by default, appear on the top of the other elements. However, the `z-index` property can specify the order of how elements are stacked on top of one another. It must be an integer (i.e. a whole number and not a decimal), and higher values for the `z-index` property of an element move it higher in the stack than those with lower values.

**Challenge**
Add a `z-index` property to the element with the class name of `first` (the red rectangle) and set it to a value of 2 so it covers the other element (blue rectangle).

---
**Tips**

- The element with class `first` should have a `z-index` value of 2.

**Solution**
```html
<style>
  div {
    width: 60%;
    height: 200px;
    margin-top: 20px;
  }
  
  .first {
    background-color: red;
    position: absolute;
    z-index:2;
  }
  .second {
    background-color: blue;
    position: absolute;
    left: 40px;
    top: 50px;
    z-index: 1;
  }
</style>

<div class="first"></div>
<div class="second"></div>
```
