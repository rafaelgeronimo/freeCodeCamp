Now let's start fresh and talk about CSS inheritance.

Every HTML page has a `body` element.

---
We can prove that the `body` element exists here by giving it a `background-color` of black.

We can do this by adding the following to our `style` element:

```
body {
  background-color: black;
}
```

---
**Tips**:

- Give your body element the background-color of black.

- Make sure your CSS rule is properly formatted with both opening and closing curly brackets.

- Make sure your CSS rule ends with a semi-colon.

---
**Resolution**:
```
<style>
body {
  background-color: black;
}
</style>
```
