# Declare String Variables

Previously we have used the code

```js
var myName = "your name";
```

`"your name"` is called a *string literal*. It is a string because it is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

---

## Challenge

Create two new `string` variables: `myFirstName` and `myLastName` and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.

---

## Tips

- `myFirstName` should be a string with at least one character in it.

- `myLastName` should be a string with at least one character in it.

### Code before

```js
// Example
var firstName = "Alan";
var lastName = "Turing";

// Only change code below this line


```

## Solution

```js
// Example
var firstName = "Alan";
var lastName = "Turing";

// Only change code below this line

var myFirstName = "Rafael";
var myLastName = "Geronimo";
```
