# Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript

We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the / symbol for division.

**Example**

```js
myVar = 16 / 2; // assigned 8
```

---

## Challenge

Change the `0` so that the `quotient` is equal to `2`.

---

## Tips

- Make the variable `quotient` equal to 2.

- Use the `/` operator

### Code before

```js
var quotient = 66 / 0;


```

---

## Solution

```js
var quotient = 66 / 33;


```
