# Compound Assignment With Augmented Division

The `/=` operator divides a variable by another number.

```js
myVar = myVar / 5;
```

Will divide `myVar` by `5`. This can be rewritten as:

```js
myVar /= 5;
```

---

## Challenge

Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `/=` operator.

---

## Tips

- `a` should equal `4`

- `b` should equal `27`

- `c` should equal `3`

- You should use the `/=` operator for each variable

- Do not modify the code above the line

---

### Code before

```js
var a = 48;
var b = 108;
var c = 33;

// Only modify code below this line

a = a / 12;
b = b / 4;
c = c / 11;

```

---

## Solution

```js
var a = 48;
var b = 108;
var c = 33;

// Only modify code below this line

a/= 12;
b/= 4;
c/= 11;

```
