# Decrement a Number with JavaScript

You can easily *decrement* or decrease a variable by one with the `--` operator.

`i--;`

is the equivalent of

`i = i - 1;`

**Note**

The entire line becomes `i--;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

---

## Challenge

Change the code to use the `--` operator on `myVar`.

---

## Tips

- `myVar` should equal `10`

- `myVar = myVar - 1;` should be changed

- Use the `--` operator on `myVar`

- Do not change code above the line

---

### Code before

```js
var myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar - 1;
```

---

## Solution

```js
var myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar--;

```
