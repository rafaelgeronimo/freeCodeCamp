# Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays

With JavaScript `array` variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

`var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"].`

---

## Challenge

Modify the new array `myArray` so that it contains both a `string` and a `number` (in that order).

**Hint**

Refer to the example code in the text editor if you get stuck.

---

## Tips

- `myArray` should be an `array`.

- The first item in `myArray` should be a `string`.

- The second item in `myArray` should be a `number`.

### Code before

```js
// Example
var ourArray = ["John", 23];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = [];

```

---

## Solution

```js
// Example
var ourArray = ["John", 23];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = ["Rafael", 42];

```
