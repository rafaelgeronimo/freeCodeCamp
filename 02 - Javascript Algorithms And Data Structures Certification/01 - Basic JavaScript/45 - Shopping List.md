# Shopping List

## Challenge

Create a shopping list in the variable `myList`. The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.

The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the item. The second element should be a number representing the quantity i.e.

`["Chocolate Bar", 15]`

There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list.
