# Profile Lookup

We have an array of objects representing different people in our contacts lists.

A `lookUpProfile` function that takes `name` and a property (`prop`) as arguments has been pre-written for you.

The function should check if `name` is an actual contact's `firstName` and the given property (`prop`) is a property of that contact.

If both are true, then return the "value" of that property.

If `name` does not correspond to any contacts then return `"No such contact"`

If `prop` does not correspond to any valid properties of a contact found to match `name` then return `"No such property"`

## Tips

- `"Kristian", "lastName"` should return `"Vos"`

- `"Sherlock", "likes"` should return `["Intriguing Cases", "Violin"]`

- `"Harry","likes"` should return an array

- `"Bob", "number"` should return "No such contact"

- `"Bob", "potato"` should return "No such contact"

- `"Akira", "address"` should return "No such property"
