# Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript

We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as *floating point* numbers or floats.

**Note**

Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in floating point. This can lead to rounding errors. [Details Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems).
