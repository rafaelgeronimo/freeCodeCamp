# Increment a Number with JavaScript

You can easily *increment* or add one to a variable with the `++` operator.

`i++;`

is the equivalent of

`i = i + 1;`

**Note**

The entire line becomes `i++;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

---

## Challenge

Change the code to use the `++` operator on `myVar`.

**Hint**

Learn more about [Arithmetic operators - Increment (++)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators#Increment_()).

---

## Tips

- `myVar` should equal `88`

- `myVar = myVar + 1;` should be changed

- Use the `++` operator

- Do not change code above the line

---

### Code before

```js
var myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar + 1;

```

---

## Solution

```js
var myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar++;

```
