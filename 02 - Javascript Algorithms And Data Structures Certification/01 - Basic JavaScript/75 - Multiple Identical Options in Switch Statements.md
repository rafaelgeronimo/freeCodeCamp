# Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements

If the `break` statement is omitted from a `switch` statement's `case`, the following `case` statement(s) are executed until a `break` is encountered. If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a `switch` statement like this:

```js
switch(val) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
    result = "1, 2, or 3";
    break;
  case 4:
    result = "4 alone";
}
```

Cases for 1, 2, and 3 will all produce the same result.

## Challenge

Write a switch statement to set `answer` for the following ranges:
`1-3` - "Low"
`4-6` - "Mid"
`7-9` - "High"

### Note

You will need to have a `case` statement for each number in the range.

---

## Tips

- `sequentialSizes(1)` should return "Low"

- `sequentialSizes(2)` should return "Low"

- `sequentialSizes(3)` should return "Low"

- `sequentialSizes(4)` should return "Mid"

- `sequentialSizes(5)` should return "Mid"

- `sequentialSizes(6)` should return "Mid"

- `sequentialSizes(7)` should return "High"

- `sequentialSizes(8)` should return "High"

- `sequentialSizes(9)` should return "High"

- You should not use any `if` or `else` statements

- You should have nine `case` statements

---

## Solution

```js
function sequentialSizes(val) {
  var answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
  switch(val){
    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 3:
      answer = "Low";
      break;
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
      answer = "Mid";
      break;
    case 7:
    case 8:
    case 9:
      answer = "High";
      break;
  }
  
  
  // Only change code above this line  
  return answer;  
}

// Change this value to test
sequentialSizes(1);
```
