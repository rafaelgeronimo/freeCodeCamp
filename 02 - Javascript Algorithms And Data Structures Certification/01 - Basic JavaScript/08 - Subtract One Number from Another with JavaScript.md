# Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript

We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the `-` symbol for subtraction.

**Example**

```js
myVar = 12 - 6; // assigned 6
```

---

## Challenge

Change the `0` so the difference is `12`.

---

## Tips

- Make the variable `difference` equal 12.

- Only subtract one number from 45.

---

### Code before

```js
var difference = 45 - 0;


```

---

## Solution

```js
var difference = 45 - 33;


```
