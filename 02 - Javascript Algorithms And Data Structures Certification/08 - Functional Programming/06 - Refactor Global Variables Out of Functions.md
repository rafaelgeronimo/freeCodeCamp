# Refactor Global Variables Out of Functions

So far, we have seen two distinct principles for functional programming:

1) Don't alter a variable or object - create new variables and objects and return them if need be from a function.

2) Declare function arguments - any computation inside a function depends only on the arguments, and not on any global object or variable.

Adding one to a number is not very exciting, but we can apply these principles when working with arrays or more complex objects.

## Challenge

Refactor (rewrite) the code so the global array `bookList` is not changed inside either function. The `add` function should add the given `bookName` to the end of an array. The `remove` function should remove the given `bookName` from an array. Both functions should return an array, and any new parameters should be added before the `bookName` one.

## Tips

- `bookList` should not change and still equal `["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"]`.

- `newBookList` should equal `["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae", "A Brief History of Time"]`.

- `newerBookList` should equal `["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"]`.

- `newestBookList` should equal `["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae", "A Brief History of Time"]`.
