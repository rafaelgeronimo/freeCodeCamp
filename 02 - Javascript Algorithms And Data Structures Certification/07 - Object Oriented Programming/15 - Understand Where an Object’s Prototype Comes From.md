# Understand Where an Objectâ€™s Prototype Comes From

Just like people inherit genes from their parents, an object inherits its `prototype` directly from the constructor function that created it. For example, here the `Bird` constructor creates the `duck` object:

```js
function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let duck = new Bird("Donald");
```

`duck` inherits its `prototype` from the `Bird` constructor function. You can show this relationship with the `isPrototypeOf` method:

```js
Bird.prototype.isPrototypeOf(duck);
// returns true
```

## Challenge

Use `isPrototypeOf` to check the `prototype` of `beagle`.

---

## Tips

- Show that `Dog.prototype` is the `prototype` of `beagle`

---

## Solution

```js
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

// Add your code below this line

Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle);
```
